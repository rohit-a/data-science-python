# How are countries faring against Covid19 - Using Pandas and Seaborn to collect, transform and visualize data

One of the most popular datasets for COVID-19 is made available by Johns Hopkins University Centre for Systems Science and Engineering on [GitHub](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). There are three different CSV data files at country level that record daily Confirmed cases, Recovered cases and Deaths.

In this project, I have utilized pandas to read, transpose and combine data from GitHub. Pandas was also very handy to create additional metrics and perform calculations. Seaborn was used to visualize processed data.
